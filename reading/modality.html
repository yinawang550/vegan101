    <h2>Modality Effect</h2>
    <p class="quote">"The modality effect refers to a cognitive load learning effect that occurs when a mixed-mode (partly visual and partly auditory) presentation of information is more effective than a single-mode (either visual or auditory alone) presentation of the same information...It occurs when multiple sources of information that must be mentally integrated before they can be understood result in superior learning using spoken (and therefore auditory) information rather than written (and therefore visual) information."</p>

    <h4>Modality effect occurs when:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Visual is linked with auditory (spoken) rather than visual (written) statements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Auditory material is essential and not redundant.
      </li>
      <li>
        If one or other source of info is redundant, the modality principle will not apply.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Modality Effect Works</h2>
    <p class="textP">
      Both visualising and reading are visual tasks, it is possible that
      performing both tasks resulted in the overload of the visual memory store.

      Eliminating one visual task, reading, by presenting the material in an
      auditory mode enabled processing to occur in the two separate stores.
      The use of the two stores increased effective working memory capacity
      and enhanced recall.<br>
      <br>
      According to the modality principle, students learn better when the
      associated statements are narrated rather than presented visually.
