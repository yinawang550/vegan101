    <p>
      Here is a site that we are working on to explain different learning theories. The intention of the site is purely explanational, so comments and likes are not necessary.

    <p>
      We would like to remove the post information near the title, as well as the comment box. We will attempt to do so by modifying the CSS on the page.

      The goal is to select both elements and use the display: none; code to hide them. If need be, I can always bring them back later.
