    <p>
      Here is a proposed solution for the problem. I have isolated the two classes for the two elements: 
      <ul>
        <li>entry-meta</li>
        <li>comments-area</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I have selected both of them in the CSS and applied display:none; to both of them. However, when the CSS is saved and applied, nothing in the original web page changes.</p>
  




    <div class="buttons">
      <a href="problem.html">Previous: Problem</a>
      <a href="modality.html">Next: Modality</a>
    </div>
